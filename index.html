        - **Advertising Example**: An Indian firm's slogan: "You've tried the Cowboys. Now try the Indians." 
          - This plays on the connotation of cowboys (dishonest) and contrasts it with the idea of Indians (honest and reliable).

        - Individual experiences shape how we perceive words.
          - **Dog**:

      - **Diamond**: Think about what diamonds symbolize for you personally (e.g., wealth, love, or something else).

      - Note: Lost its strong connotation after she left office.
    
    ## Geographical Variations in Connotation

    ## Using Dictionaries
    
    - Good modern dictionaries provide information on widely shared connotations, which can help learners understand nuances in meaning.
